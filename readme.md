# how to use
this is a some-what functional website for a non-existing cake place called "let them eat cake;"- which has subsequent sub-menu's that can help navigate throughout the whole of the website. whenever you click on anything on the page you get an alert, and when you click on the menu specifically it opens up a new tab with the different pages.
# the home page
the home page is the entry point into the website, and helps you navigate to other sub-sections of the website. on top is a functional navigation bar that leads to the about, catalog, top selling cakes, contact form, and the stores contact information. when anything is left clicked there is an alert that pops up to "strongly encourage" potential customers to go ahead and buy the cakes. 
# the about page
the about page is a simple over-view of the company who's company name is a referenance to Marie Antionette's "let them eat cake" quote - which has historically been missattributed and misquoted as something she had said prior to her execution, when it was not the fact at all. irony at its' finest for a fictional cake company created simply for this project. there is a small blurb on this about page - along with that same navigation bar and click function that exists for all the other pages (except the contact page)
# catalog 
there is a gallery of cakes in this sub-category that looked aesthetically pleasing. when you hover over them they have an effect that rounds the edges of the pictures. there are no prices and no names for these cakes for aesthetic purposes.
# top selling
the top selling cakes are the prettiest of the gallery of cakes that would, supposedly, sell the best in this make-believe store
# contact form
the contact form is an actual working form where someone who wanted to contact the company could supposedly submit their information to be contacted back. it includes fields for name, email, and location - along with a "password" box that could be used if you wanted to re-login to the website to see if they even saw your info to contact you.
# our contact info
this is the section of the website that shows the companys contact info, which is convienently located in the same location as we are right now. please do not attempt to contact this company
